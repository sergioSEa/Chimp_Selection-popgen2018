Question to answer: is there POSITIVE selection in the exomes of chimp subsp?

Outgroup: subsp that is further from the others : verus will be our outgroup since it is already stated as distinctive in literature. 
We want to see if there is a diff positive selection between diff subsp, (expl: the outgroup will be from the same sp because are looking for intra-sp selection)

Tasks:
Data exploration→ PCA & admixture = to see if the subsp are well separated→ we have them from the exercises (28th Feb)… plot & infer general conclusions

Background/Literature on subsp→ Choose 1 subsp (the one the more endangered, habitat...inform ourselves!!) and focus on that

Methods→ How to check positive selection? Make it in diff methods (tajima, PBS:by hand, compare in pairs 1-1, 1-2,1-3/2-2etc to calculate distances , heterozygosity across the chr→ lower:all chimpanzees look alike because they are adapted to sth...) and choose the best
Decide whether we’re checking selection-hotspots separately (genes that tend to be inherited together etc) 

Background/Literature on genes→ check the genes that are selected→ function / structure / …

It seems that the AIDS was transmitted through verus to humans→ Check if there is selection in immune sys genes

Tasks:
Tajima’s D: Hubert
PBS: Isma & Marta
Heterozygosity: Sergio 
Data Exploration: Miren
Background Work and Information: Melissa

To do: Compare result, investigate genes and regions under selection
